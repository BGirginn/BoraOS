# BoraOS 0.1 - mkinitcpio configuration
# Sprint 1 - Initramfs module configuration
#
# This is the configuration file for mkinitcpio, which creates the initial ramdisk
# environment for the Linux kernel during boot.

# MODULES
# The following modules are loaded before any boot hooks are run.
# Advanced users may wish to specify all system modules in this array.
# For example:
#     MODULES=(piix ide_disk reiserfs)
MODULES=()

# BINARIES
# This setting includes any additional binaries a given user may wish into
# the CPIO image. This is run last, so it may be used to override the actual
# binaries included by a given hook.
# BINARIES are dependency parsed, so you may safely ignore libraries
BINARIES=()

# FILES
# This setting is similar to BINARIES above, however, files are added as-is
# and are not parsed in any way. This is useful for config files.
FILES=()

# HOOKS
# This is the most important setting in this file. The HOOKS control the
# modules and scripts added to the image, and what happens at boot time.
# Order is important, and it is recommended that you do not change the order
# in which HOOKS are added. Run 'mkinitcpio -H <hook name>' for help on a
# given hook.
#
# BoraOS Sprint 1 Hook Configuration:
# - base: Essential base initramfs components
# - udev: Device manager for dynamic device nodes
# - keyboard: Keyboard support for early userspace
# - block: Block device support
# - filesystems: Filesystem support (squashfs, ext4, etc.)
# - usb_storage: USB storage device support (required for USB boot)
# - nvme: NVMe SSD support (modern storage)
# - virtio: VirtIO support (virtual machine compatibility)
# - btrfs: Btrfs filesystem support (modern Linux filesystem)
#
# Note: encrypt, lvm2, and resume are NOT included per Sprint 1 specification
# as they are not required for the live environment.
HOOKS=(base udev modconf keyboard block filesystems archiso)

# COMPRESSION
# Use this to compress the initramfs image. By default, gzip compression
# is used. Use 'cat' to create an uncompressed image.
#COMPRESSION="gzip"
#COMPRESSION="bzip2"
#COMPRESSION="lzma"
#COMPRESSION="xz"
#COMPRESSION="lzop"
#COMPRESSION="lz4"
#COMPRESSION="zstd"
COMPRESSION="zstd"

# COMPRESSION_OPTIONS
# Additional options for the compressor
COMPRESSION_OPTIONS=(-9)
